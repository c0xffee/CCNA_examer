Correct Answer: D
Section: part 1

Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
remote office 使用非思科路由器，则main office 是思科路由器。
HDLC是Cisco路由器在同步串行线路上的默认封装方式。每个厂商的HDLC都是专用的。
PPP 用于异步串行（拨号）或同步串行（isdn）介质。PPP的基本目标是在数据链路层点到点链路上传输
第3层包。它不是一个专用协议，这就意味着如果你的路由器并不都是Cisco的，可以在串行接口上配置
PPP封装。串行接口两端的路由器都配置PPP才能工作。
帧中继有两种封装类型----Cisco和IETF.除非手动输入IETF，否则默认封装是Cisco。如果用帧中继连接一条
Cisco设备和一条非Cisco设备，要选择IETF封装类型。命令格式如下
Router(config)#int s0/0/0
Router(config-if)#encapsulation ?
frame-relay Frame Relay networks
hdlc Serial HDLC synchronous
ppp Point-to-Point protocol
Router(config-if)#encapsulation frame-relay ?
ietf Use RFC1490/RFC2427 encapsulation
<cr>
由此判断选项B 和C，命令格式不正确。
如果当一台思科路由器和一台非思科路由器通过串行连接在一起时，必须配置PPP或另外一种封装方法，像
帧中继，因为默认的HDLC不能工作。

A router is commonly considered a DTE device
A router is commonly considered a DCE device

Correct Answer: ADE
Section: part 1
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
SU/DSU是用于连接终端和数字专线的设备，属于DCE设备
modem用于数字信号和模拟信号的转换，属于DCE设备
路由器一般是DTE设备
DTE和DCE的区别;
DCE是数据通信设备，如MODEM，连接DTE设备的通信设备。一般广域网常用的DCE设备有：CSU/DSU,
广域网交换机，MODEM。
DTE,DCE的之间的区别是DCE一方提供时钟，DTE不提供时钟，但它依靠DCE提供的时钟工作，比如PC机
和MODEM之间。数据传输通常是经过DTE-DCE，再经过DCE-DTE的路径。其实对于标准的串行端口，通
常从外观就能判断是DTE还是DCE，DTE是针头（俗称公头),DCE是孔头，（俗称母头），这样两种接口才
能接再一起。
ROUTER之间用串口的时候一般无所谓哪头是DCE，哪头是DTE。有的是默认规定好的，比如modem永远
是DCE，与其相连的电信程控交换机则为DCE，配的时候DCE不设置clock rate的话，无法通信。

如图，每个交换机都配置了主机名，也都运行了RSTP，在就没有做其他的配置了。下面哪三个选项正确的

描述了RSTP的端口角色？
考点分析：
1.判断根桥，通过比较各个网桥的Mac地址，桥Mac地址最小的为根桥，所以根桥是C，根桥上的所有端口
是指定端口。
2.判断非根桥上的跟端口。在同一个交换机上，到根网桥的cost较小的那个端口会成为root port。所以
SwitchA Fa0/1，SwitchD Gi0/2，SwitchB Gi0/1会成为相应交换机上的RP。
3.判断每个网段上的指定端口。 SWA--SWB段：SWA的F0/2端口的cost为19，SWB的G0/2端口cost为4
+19=23，所以SWA的F0/2为指定端口。 SWB--SWD段：SWB的G0/1端口cost为19+19=38，SWD的G0/1
端口cost为19，所以SWD的G0/1端口为指定端口。
4.剩余SWB的G0/2端口既不是指定端口，又不是根端口，处于堵塞状态。
注：100M链路cost为19.1000M链路cost为4.
